# Firmware Update Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Documentation Restructuring ✅
- Created organized `docs/` directory structure with subdirectories for user, developer, and project documentation
- Moved existing technical reports to appropriate locations:
  - `REPORT.md` → `docs/developer/architecture/app-overview.md`
  - `FIRMWARE_REPORT.md` → `docs/developer/architecture/firmware-overview.md`
  - `OTA_DFU_REPORT.md` → `docs/developer/architecture/ota-implementation.md`
  - `FIRMWARE_BUILD_AND_OTA.md` → `docs/developer/setup/firmware-build.md`
  - `tracking.md` → `docs/project/progress.md`
- Created new project README.md with proper overview and quick start guide
- Created documentation index at `docs/README.md` for easy navigation

### 2. Firmware Button Behavior Changes ✅
Modified the button behavior in `firmware/devkit/src/button.c`:

#### Previous Behavior (Problematic):
- Single tap: Power off device
- Double tap: Detected but no action
- Long press: Detected but no action
- Triple tap: Not implemented

#### New Behavior (Implemented):
- **Single tap**: Toggle recording on/off with LED indicator
- **Double tap**: Available for custom action
- **Triple tap**: Special mode activation (implemented detection)
- **Long press**: Power off device

#### Technical Changes:
- Added recording toggle logic using `mic_on()` and `mic_off()` functions
- Added red LED indicator for recording state
- Implemented triple tap detection with 900ms window
- Added `BUTTON_EVENT_TRIPLE_TAP` enum and `notify_triple_tap()` function
- Enhanced tap counting logic with proper state management

### 3. CLAUDE.md Updates ✅
Enhanced the CLAUDE.md file with:
- Current firmware button functionality warnings
- Documentation structure guidance
- Firmware compilation and deployment instructions
- Key documentation file references

## Next Steps for Firmware Deployment

### Building the Firmware

Due to the Docker image being too large to download quickly, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Use Docker (Recommended)
```bash
cd firmware
./scripts/build-docker.sh
# Output will be in: firmware/build/docker_build/zephyr.zip
```
Note: This requires downloading a large Docker image (~4GB) which may take time.

#### Option 2: Use nRF Connect SDK
1. Install nRF Connect SDK v2.7.0
2. Open `firmware/devkit` in VS Code with nRF Connect extension
3. Build with CMake preset: `xiao_ble_sense_devkitv2-adafruit`
4. Generate OTA package:
```bash
cd firmware/devkit/build/[build_directory]/zephyr
adafruit-nrfutil dfu genpkg --dev-type 0x0052 --dev-revision 0xCE68 --application zephyr.hex firmware_update.zip
```

### Deploying to the App

Once you have the `firmware_update.zip` or `zephyr.zip` file:

1. **Via File Selection in App**:
   - Transfer the .zip file to your mobile device
   - In the app, navigate to firmware update section
   - Use "Select Firmware File (.zip)" button
   - Select the firmware file and start update

2. **Via App Assets** (for bundled firmware):
   - Place the firmware .zip file in the app's assets directory
   - Update the app code to reference this bundled firmware
   - Rebuild and deploy the Flutter app

## Important Notes

1. **Test Before Deployment**: The button behavior changes are significant. Test thoroughly on development hardware before deploying to production devices.

2. **Recording Implementation**: The single tap now toggles recording, but ensure the recording infrastructure is properly initialized in the main firmware loop.

3. **LED Feedback**: Red LED indicates recording state. Ensure LED hardware is properly configured for your device variant.

4. **Power Management**: Long press now powers off the device (moved from single tap). This is more user-friendly and prevents accidental shutdowns.

5. **Triple Tap**: The detection is implemented but the actual action needs to be defined based on your use case.

## Code Changes Summary

### Modified Files:
1. `firmware/devkit/src/button.c` - Complete button behavior overhaul
2. `README.md` - New project overview
3. `docs/README.md` - Documentation index
4. `CLAUDE.md` - Enhanced guidance

### Key Function Changes:
- Single tap handler: Now calls `mic_on()`/`mic_off()` instead of `turnoff_all()`
- Long press handler: Now calls `turnoff_all()` for power off
- Added `notify_triple_tap()` function
- Enhanced tap detection state machine with triple tap support

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying the new firmware:
- [ ] Build firmware successfully
- [ ] Test single tap recording toggle
- [ ] Verify LED indicator works
- [ ] Test double tap (should notify but take no action)
- [ ] Test triple tap detection
- [ ] Test long press power off
- [ ] Verify no accidental power offs
- [ ] Test OTA update process
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility with app
