# Firmware Build Success Report

## Build Completed Successfully! üéâ

The firmware has been successfully built with all the requested button behavior changes.

### Build Details
- **Docker Image Used**: `ghcr.io/zephyrproject-rtos/ci:v0.26.13`
- **SDK Version**: nRF Connect SDK v2.7.0
- **Board Target**: xiao_ble/nrf52840/sense
- **Configuration**: prj_xiao_ble_sense_devkitv2-adafruit.conf

### Generated Firmware Files
Located in `/Users/unforced/Documents/Building/my-omi/firmware/build/docker_build/`:
- `zephyr.hex` (806K) - Raw firmware hex file
- `zephyr.bin` (287K) - Binary firmware file  
- `zephyr.uf2` (574K) - UF2 firmware file for direct flashing
- `zephyr.zip` (287K) - OTA update package

### Button Behavior Changes Implemented

#### Previous Behavior (Fixed)
- Single tap: Power off device ‚ùå
- Double tap: No action
- Long press: No action
- Triple tap: Not implemented

#### New Behavior (Implemented)
- **Single tap**: Toggle recording on/off with red LED indicator ‚úÖ
- **Double tap**: Detected and notifies app (ready for custom action) ‚úÖ
- **Triple tap**: Fully implemented with 900ms detection window ‚úÖ
- **Long press (‚â•1s)**: Power off device ‚úÖ

### Code Changes Summary
Modified `firmware/devkit/src/button.c`:
1. Moved power-off from single tap to long press
2. Added recording toggle on single tap with `mic_on()`/`mic_off()`
3. Implemented triple tap detection with proper timing
4. Added LED feedback for recording state
5. Enhanced tap counting logic with `tap_count` variable

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Via Flutter App Assets (Already Set Up)
The firmware has been copied to:
- `/Users/unforced/Documents/Building/my-omi/assets/firmware/devkit-v2-firmware.zip`
- Added to `pubspec.yaml` assets section

To use in the app:
```dart
// Load firmware from assets
final ByteData data = await rootBundle.load('assets/firmware/devkit-v2-firmware.zip');
final Uint8List firmwareBytes = data.buffer.asUint8List();
// Use with firmware update function
```

#### Option 2: Direct File Selection
Users can select the firmware file from:
- `/Users/unforced/Documents/Building/my-omi/firmware/build/docker_build/zephyr.zip`

#### Option 3: Direct Flash via UF2
1. Put device in bootloader mode (double-tap reset)
2. Copy `zephyr.uf2` to the XIAO-SENSE drive that appears

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Flash firmware to device
- [ ] Test single tap starts/stops recording
- [ ] Verify red LED turns on during recording
- [ ] Test double tap sends notification to app
- [ ] Test triple tap detection works
- [ ] Test long press powers off device
- [ ] Verify no accidental power-offs with single tap
- [ ] Test OTA update process from app

### Key Solution
The build succeeded by using a specific Docker image version (`v0.26.13`) instead of `latest`. This resolved the picolibc compatibility issues that were occurring with the newer Docker image.

### Next Steps
1. Test the firmware on actual hardware
2. Verify all button behaviors work as expected
3. Test the OTA update process
4. Consider adding custom actions for double/triple tap
