# Automatic Firmware Update Implementation

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully implemented automatic firmware updates using the bundled firmware file. The app no longer requires users to manually select firmware files.

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Automatic Firmware Loading**
   - The app now uses the bundled firmware at `assets/firmware/devkit-v2-firmware.zip`
   - No need for file picker for standard updates
   - One-click firmware update button

2. **Firmware Version Display**
   - Shows current device firmware version (simulated for now)
   - Shows available firmware version
   - Visual indicator when update is available (orange badge)

3. **Smart Update Button**
   - Changes to "Install Update" when new version available
   - Shows "Reinstall Firmware" when already up-to-date
   - Color-coded: Orange for updates, Blue for reinstall

4. **Advanced User Option**
   - Small "Select custom firmware" link for advanced users
   - Allows manual firmware file selection if needed
   - Maintains flexibility for development/testing

### Technical Implementation

#### Modified Files

1. **lib/utils/firmware_mixin.dart**
   - Added `assetPath` parameter to `startDfu()` and `startMCUDfu()`
   - Added support for loading firmware from assets using `rootBundle.load()`
   - Maintains backward compatibility with file path loading

2. **lib/main.dart**
   - Added firmware version state variables
   - Added `_checkFirmwareVersion()` method (currently simulated)
   - Enhanced UI to show version information
   - Simplified main update button to use bundled firmware
   - Added automatic version check on device connection

3. **pubspec.yaml**
   - Already had assets declaration for firmware directory

### How It Works

1. **On Device Connection**:
   - App automatically checks firmware version
   - Compares with bundled firmware version
   - Shows update notification if newer version available

2. **Update Process**:
   - User clicks "Update Firmware" button
   - App loads firmware from `assets/firmware/devkit-v2-firmware.zip`
   - Firmware is sent to device using MCUMgr protocol
   - Progress indicator shows update status

3. **The Bundled Firmware**:
   - Located at: `assets/firmware/devkit-v2-firmware.zip`
   - Contains the button behavior fixes:
     - Single tap: Toggle recording
     - Double tap: Custom action ready
     - Triple tap: Implemented
     - Long press: Power off

### Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Get Actual Firmware Version**:
   - Currently using simulated version "1.0.0"
   - Need to implement actual version reading from device
   - Could be done via BLE characteristic or device info

2. **Version Comparison Logic**:
   - Implement proper semantic version comparison
   - Handle version parsing edge cases

3. **Auto-Update Option**:
   - Add setting to automatically install updates
   - Show notification when update available
   - Background check for updates

### Testing Instructions

1. **Build and Install**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Connect Device**:
   - Turn on Omi device
   - Scan and connect in app

3. **Update Firmware**:
   - Check version display shows current/latest
   - Click "Update Firmware" button
   - Watch progress indicator
   - Device will restart after update

4. **Verify New Button Behavior**:
   - Single tap: Should toggle recording (red LED)
   - Long press: Should power off device
   - No more accidental power-offs!

### Benefits

- **User-Friendly**: No need to find and select firmware files
- **Foolproof**: Users can't select wrong firmware files
- **Version Aware**: Shows when updates are available
- **Developer-Friendly**: Still allows custom firmware for testing
- **Integrated**: Firmware ships with app, ensuring compatibility
