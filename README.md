# Omi Minimal Fork

A streamlined implementation of the Omi wearable AI device, focusing on core audio capture and BLE connectivity features.

## Overview

This is a minimal fork of the [Omi project](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi) that provides:
- üéôÔ∏è Real-time audio streaming from Omi hardware to mobile app
- üì± Cross-platform Flutter application (iOS, Android, Desktop)
- üîä Offline audio recording with device storage
- üîÑ Over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates
- üéØ Simplified, focused feature set for audio capture

## Key Features

### Mobile Application
- **BLE Device Discovery**: Automatic scanning and connection to Omi devices
- **Audio Streaming**: Real-time audio capture with Opus codec support
- **Recording Management**: Save, play, share, and delete audio recordings
- **Firmware Updates**: Built-in OTA/DFU support for keeping device up-to-date
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux

### Firmware
- **Zephyr RTOS**: Built on robust real-time operating system
- **Audio Codecs**: PCM8/16, Opus, and ŒºLaw support
- **Offline Recording**: Continue recording when disconnected from app
- **Button Controls**: Configurable button gestures for device control
- **Low Power**: Optimized for extended battery life

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest stable)
- For firmware development: Docker or nRF Connect SDK v2.7.0
- Omi hardware device or compatible nRF52840 development board

### Running the App

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-omi.git
cd my-omi

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```

### Building Firmware

```bash
# Using Docker (recommended)
cd firmware
./scripts/build-docker.sh

# The firmware package will be at:
# firmware/build/docker_build/zephyr.zip
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory:

- [Architecture Overview](docs/developer/architecture/) - Technical deep-dives
- [Build Instructions](docs/developer/setup/firmware-build.md) - Detailed build guides

## Current Status

This minimal fork implements core functionality while removing complex features from the original Omi project. See [progress tracking](docs/project/progress.md) for implementation status.

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ BLE connection and device discovery
- ‚úÖ Audio streaming and recording
- ‚úÖ File management (save/play/share/delete)
- ‚úÖ Firmware OTA updates
- ‚úÖ Basic UI for all core features

### Recent Updates (December 2024)
- ‚úÖ Button controls implemented (single tap = record toggle)
- ‚úÖ Visual button event indicators in app
- ‚úÖ Automatic firmware updates (v2.0.10 bundled)
- ‚úÖ Improved firmware version detection
